As we float through everyday life, we slowly discover what has meaning. What may be meaningful for you, is not for others. Learn to love this difference, and then progress is inevitable.

Everything in the world is somehow designed, and everything that's designed can be improved. That's an extremely powerful thought that I can't manage to forget. Because of this, I have a high standard for my work. Design is all about choices; whether they are good or bad, is up to the designer.

I attended the Art Institute of Pittsburgh for Web Design, and the Erie County Technical School for Computer Programming while in high school.
