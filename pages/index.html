<p>As we float through everyday life, we slowly discover what has meaning. What may be meaningful for you, is not for others. Learn to love this difference, and then progress is inevitable.</p>

<p>Everything in the world is somehow designed, and everything that's designed can be improved. That's an extremely powerful thought that I can't manage to forget. Because of this, I have a high standard for my work. Design is all about choices; whether they are good or bad, is up to the designer.</p>

<p>I attended the Art Institute of Pittsburgh for Web Design, and the Erie County Technical School for Computer Programming while in high school. That experience has showed me a new view on this world, and gave me the ambition to try to fix it and make it more beautiful. I'm also obsessed with space and electronic dance music.</p>

<p>I'm across the web on <a href="https://twitter.com/{{ site.username }}" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://instagram.com/{{ site.username }}" target="_blank">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://github.com/{{ site.username }}" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, and probably elsewhere as {{ site.username }}.</p>

<p>For those interested, here is my <a href="{{ site.url }}/resume">résumé.</a></p>
